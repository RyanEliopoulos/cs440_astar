<h1>AStar</h1>
<p>AStar! In this assignment, you'll implement the A<em> Search algorithm.
The stub code provides the framework for running A</em> on a generic
<code>SearchProblem</code>.  Two <code>SearchProblem</code> classes are (partially) given:
both work on simple 2D grids: the first on a grid represented by a list of lists,
the second on a grid represented as pixels from an image.</p>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<ol>
<li>Download the stub <code>astar.py</code>.</li>
<li>Look through the code.  I've written some functionality, and the goal is for you to complete it.</li>
<li>Note that there are 2 methods/functions that are unimplemented, these are where you should add your code.</li>
<li>As before the code assumes four spaces of indentation. Set your editor appropriately, this is the default for many.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Notes on the Code</h1>
<p>I've added ome descriptive doc-strings and comments. My hope is that these
will help you understand the code better and write more idiomatic python.
Here are a few items worth calling out:</p>
<p><em>heapq</em> the heapq module implements heap operations on a list. It is
worth reading about.</p>
<p><em>namedtuple</em> named tuples create objects that are immutable (like tuples)
but whose data can be accessed by name (instead of by an integer index as in a
normal tuple).  The syntax for creating a namedtuple is relatively strange
so there is a comment to explain it.</p>
<h1>Implement the methods</h1>
<p>Once the methods are implemented, you should be able to search the default
grid simply by running from the command line:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;python astar.py
</code></pre>
<p>My input/output looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>Found route for cost: 8.000000

<p>Or limiting output of the path...</p>

<h1>Turn in your code</h1>
<p>Submit your code via Autolab. If you think there's a problem with the tests,
please check the inline code specification carefully and recheck your
results.  You may also want to look at the specific test that it's failing
and try to reproduce that result. If it still looks like the tests are
incorrect, send me a message and if you're correct, I'm happy to give you
some extra credit points.</p>
